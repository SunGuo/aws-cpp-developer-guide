Welcome to the |sdk-cpp-dg|!

The AWS SDK for C++ provides a modern C++ (version C++ 11 or later) interface for Amazon Web
Services (AWS). It is meant to be performant and fully functioning with low- and high-level SDKs,
while minimizing dependencies and providing platform portability (Windows, OS X, Linux, and mobile).
